# DMM proxy


These is my work for DMM.

1. "my_OOI3"
	This is a kanColle proxy program for server

2. "nginx_conf"
	Just like its name , 
	this is a config file for my DMM games Cache server ,
	and a script to change the real config file and restart server
	
	
	
	
	
3. "OmegaOptions.bak"	
	This is a backup for the Chrome extension switchyOmega's setting file.
	It tell us :
	Where we can connect straightly , 
	Where we can connect with proxy in JP ,
	and Where we can connect with my Cache server.
